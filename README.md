# GameDB - An Example Video Game Website using IGDB API

Simple project I made to familiarize myself with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/). The site uses the [IGDB API](https://igdb.com) to get game information and populate the website. Users can search through the database of games and pull up information on the games they select. This includes release date, cover art, screenshots, average user reviews, and average critic reviews. Search results can be sorted based on relevance, critic rating, user rating, and popularity.

Bulma CSS framework was used for styling.
